# Sudoku-Puzzle-Generator
Ahh... This one is messy! One of the first projects (at level=Novice). Its supposed to generate a Sudoku puzzle for you to solve.

It works but it takes a random amount of time to generate a puzzle everytime. I was bored and things got out of hand and I was writing messier code with each passing second. I have had a couple of ideas that would generate the puzzle in constant time (haven't implemented them yet). But, I'm afraid to revisit that mess and try to recall the different things like the variables, where they fit in, etc. even tough I am the one who has written that program from scratch! But the program works,... eventually.
