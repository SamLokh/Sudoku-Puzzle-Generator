# Sudoku-Puzzle-Generator
Ahh... This one is messy! One of the first projects (at level=Novice). Its supposed to generate a Sudoku puzzle for you to solver. It works but it takes a random amount of time to generate a puzzle everytime. I was bored and things got out of hand and I was writing messier code with every passing second. I have had a couple of ideas that would generate the puzzle in constant time (haven't implemented them yet). But, I'm afraid to revisit that mess and I wrote that program from scratch! But the program works,... eventually.
